Regular expressions originated in 1956, when mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene described regular languages using his mathematical notation called regular sets.[3] These arose in theoretical computer science, in the subfields of automata theory models of computation and the description and classification of formal languages. Other early implementations of pattern matching include the SNOBOL language, which did not use regular expressions, but instead its own syntax.Regular expressions entered popular use from 1968 in two uses: pattern matching in a text editor[4] and lexical analysis in a compiler.[5] Among the first appearances of regular expressions in program form was when Ken Thompson built Kleenes notation into the editor QED as a means to match patterns in text files.[4][6][7][8] For speed, Thompson implemented regular expression matching by just-in-time compilation JIT to IBM 7094 code on the Compatible Time-Sharing System, an important early example of JIT compilation.[9] He later added this capability to the Unix editor ed, which eventually led to the popular search tool greps use of regular expressions grep is a word derived from the command for regular expression searching in the ed editor: g/re/p meaning Global search for Regular Expression and Print matching lines[10]. Around the same time when Thompson developed QED, a group of researchers including Douglas T. Ross implemented a tool based on regular expressions that is used for lexical analysis in compiler design.[5]Many variations of these original forms of regular expressions were used in Unix[8] programs at Bell Labs in the 1970s, including vi, lex, sed, AWK, and expr, and in other programs such as Emacs. Regular expressions were subsequently adopted by a wide range of programs, with these early forms standardized in the POSIX.2 standard in 1992.In the 1980s more complicated regular expressions arose in Perl, which originally derived from a regex library written by Henry Spencer 1986, who later wrote an implementation of Advanced Regular Expressions for Tcl.[11] The Tcl library is a hybrid NFA/DFA implementation with improved performance characteristics, earning praise from Jeffrey Friedl who said, ...it really seems quite wonderful.[12] Software projects that have adopted Spencers Tcl regular expression implementation include PostgreSQL.[13] Perl later expanded on Spencers original library to add many new features,[14] but has not yet caught up with Spencers Advanced Regular Expressions implementation in terms of performance or Unicode handling.[15][16] Part of the effort in the design of Perl 6 is to improve Perls regular expression integration, and to increase their scope and capabilities to allow the definition of parsing expression grammars.[17] The result is a mini-language called Perl 6 rules, which are used to define Perl 6 grammar as well as provide a tool to programmers in the language. These rules maintain existing features of Perl 5.x regular expressions, but also allow BNF-style definition of a recursive descent parser via sub-rules.The use of regular expressions in structured information standards for document and database modeling started in the 1960s and expanded in the 1980s when industry standards like ISO SGML precursored by ANSI GCA 101-1983 consolidated. The kernel of the structure specification language standards consists of regular expressions. Its use is evident in the DTD element group syntax.Starting in 1997, Philip Hazel developed PCRE Perl Compatible Regular Expressions, which attempts to closely mimic Perls regular expression functionality and is used by many modern tools including PHP and Apache HTTP Server.Today regular expressions are widely supported in programming languages, text processing programs particular lexers, advanced text editors, and some other programs. Regular expression support is part of the standard library of many programming languages, including Java and Python, and is built into the syntax of others, including Perl and ECMAScript. Implementations of regular expression functionality is often called a regular expression engine, and a number of libraries are available for reuse.
